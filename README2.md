# Text Editor

In this project I built a single page text editor application; that runs in the browser and meets the PWA (Progressive Website Application) criteria that allows it to functions offline. The motivation for creating this application is to provide the users with a unique experience through the use of a PWA rather than a normal website or an app. Through this application I gained knowledge on new techniques through the webpack bundle, such as: the webpack-pwa-manifest plugin, asset caching and workbox plugins.
