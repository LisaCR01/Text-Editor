# Text Editor

Description

In this project I built a single page text editor application; that runs in the browser (or functions offline) and meets the PWA (Progressive Website Application) criteria. The motivation for creating this application is to provide the users with a unique experience through the use of a PWA and make the website stand out from apps and normal websites. 

What was your motivation?

The motivation for creating this application is that most users of websites are mobile users who often are using their phone when on the go without stable connection. PWAs let you view a website offline and hence has better performance in unstable connection

I built this project as PWAs can make an application stand out and give its' users a unique experience to apps or normal websites.
